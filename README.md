# SQLAlchemy-Challenge
Data Bootcamp Week 9 HW on SQL Alchemy
This assignment was to do an analysis on the precipitation for Hawaii. We were to use SQL queries to get information such as maximum(high) and minimum(low) temperatures from the database in sql lite.  
I struggled with this particular assignment and relied heavily on the Xpert tool and didn't get very far. Also, I'm finding that the connection to the api is dependent on where I store my jupyter notebook. I will definitely try to do a regrade.
